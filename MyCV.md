My name is GENG Yaoyi. Born in Heilongjiang China. I am currently a PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering at _[NUI Galway](http://nuigalway.ie/)_. My research is on the functionally graded material fabricated with additive manufacturing (known as 3D printing). The material I work with is Ti6Al4V, which is widely used in biomedical applications.
